# spoa

spoa is a c++ implementation of the partial order alignment (POA) algorithm (as described in 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.452) which is used to generate consensus sequences (as described in 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg109). It supports three alighment modes: local (Smith-Waterman), global (Needleman-Wunsh) and semi-global alignment (overlap).
